\gb\ASENTRIA-ROOT-MIB Viewer\p\

This is a probe that will view the entire ASENTRIA-ROOT-MIB. The Status Window shows all the scalar values available from the MIB, and also has links to display the tables that are supported.

You must import the following MIBs before importing the probe file.

   SNMPv2-SMI
   ASENTRIA-ROOT-MIB

-- <snmp-device-properties> are flags that alter the InterMapper probe's behavior.
-- You generally do not need to use these, but they can be useful for devices that don't 
-- work as expected. For more information, see the <snmp-device-properties> section of the 
-- Developer Guide's at: http://dartware.com/support/docs/index.html

<snmp-device-properties>

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.

<parameters>

   -- No parameters specified. 

</parameters>

-- InterMapper retrieves the <snmp-device-variables> using the OID or variable names from the MIB.
-- Specify the variable name, the MIB name or OID, the format (usually DEFAULT) and a short description.
